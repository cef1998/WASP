# WASP-Windows Automation Software for People
WASP is our attempt to automate tasks performed on Microsoft Windows. It would help people not familiar with technology to operate computer systems relatively easily. People alien to this domain face difficulties in getting used to technology, WASP here serves as a handy tool. WASP performs all common tasks like opening applications, opening and closing files and folders, moving, renaming and organizing files, searching for files, compressing and decompressing files, changing system background, switching tabs, accessing utilities like webcam and microphone, shutting down the system etc. It also has additional features like playing music according to mood, reporting errors, etc. It also has an easter egg :p. This is what to hope to achieve in 36 hrs, may be with extra features to be added later if time permits.  

## Getting Started

You need a PC with Microsoft Windows support.

### Prerequisites

We need to install following libraries and environment before we begin our task.
```
python 3.6 or above
selenium
pyaudio
speech_recognition
wave
BeautifulSoup4
```
In case getting some error, install the required module.

### Installing 

#### 1. Python
  From here install the latest version of Python for Windows [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  
#### 2. Selenium 
```pip install selenium   #using pip```

Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. Firefox, for example, requires geckodriver, which needs to be installed before the below examples can be run. Make sure it’s in your PATH.

**Note:** Failure to observe this step will give you an error selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: ‘geckodriver’ executable needs to be in PATH.

We will be using Chrome WebDriver , you can download it from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)

#### 3. Speech Recoginition

  ```pip install SpeechRecognition```
  
To use its functionality we need PyAudio (for microphone users)

  ```pip install pyaudio```

#### 4. BeautifulSoup4

  Use ```pip install beautifulsoup4``` to install it or 
   
  ```python -m pip install beautifulsoup4``` do the same work.

#### 5. wave

  Use ```pip install Wave``` to install wave.
